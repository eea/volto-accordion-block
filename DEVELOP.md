### Or add @eeacms/volto-accordion-block to your Volto project

Before starting make sure your development environment is properly set. See [Volto Developer Documentation](https://docs.voltocms.com/getting-started/install/)

1.  Make sure you have installed `yo`, `@plone/generator-volto` and `mrs-developer`

        npm install -g yo @plone/generator-volto mrs-developer

1.  Create new volto app

        yo @plone/volto my-volto-project --addon @eeacms/volto-accordion-block --skip-install
        cd my-volto-project

1.  Add the following to `mrs.developer.json`:

        {
            "volto-accordion-block": {
                "url": "https://github.com/eea/volto-accordion-block.git",
                "package": "@eeacms/volto-accordion-block",
                "branch": "develop",
                "path": "src"
            }
        }

1.  Install

        make develop
        yarn

        docker run --pull always -it --rm --name plone -p 8080:8080 -e SITE=Plone plone/plone-backend

    ...you can also check http://localhost:8080/Plone

        yarn start

1.  Go to http://localhost:3000

1.  Happy hacking!

        cd src/addons/volto-accordion-block/

## Cypress

To run cypress locally, first make sure you don't have any Volto/Plone running on ports `8080` and `3000`.

You don't have to be in a `clean-volto-project`, you can be in any Volto Frontend
project where you added `volto-accordion-block` to `mrs.developer.json`

Go to:

  ```BASH
  cd src/addons/volto-accordion-block/
  ```

Start:

  ```Bash
  make
  make start
  ```

This will build and start with Docker a clean `Plone backend` and `Volto Frontend` with `volto-accordion-block` block installed.

Open Cypress Interface:

  ```Bash
  make cypress-open
  ```

Or run it:

  ```Bash
  make cypress-run
  ```

## Prettier

## Eslint

[ESLint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint) is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code.

Eslint should run just fine using the setup config from any Volto projects generated by `volto project generator`.

If for some reason that doesn't work, and you need to manually install eslint,
you can also use the following steps to install eslint.

For installing ``eslint``, execute the following command:

  ```bash
  yarn add --dev eslint eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y eslint-plugin-prettier eslint-plugin-react-hooks eslint-plugin-import eslint-plugin-flowtype
  ```

For setting up ``eslint``, execute the following command:

  ```bash
  cp .project.eslintrc.js .eslintrc.js
  ```

Run ``eslint``, executing the following command:

  ```bash
  make lint
  ```

To fix the problems found by ``eslint``, execute the following command:

  ```bash
  make lint-fix
  ```

## Stylelint

[Stylelint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stylelint) is a mighty CSS linter that helps you avoid errors and enforce conventions.

  ```bash

  ```

To run ``stylelint``, execute the following command:
