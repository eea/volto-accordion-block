### Or add volto-accordion-block to your Volto project

Before starting make sure your development environment is properly set. See [Volto Developer Documentation](https://6.docs.plone.org/volto/getting-started/install.html)

1.  Make sure you have installed `yo`, `@plone/generator-volto` and `mrs-developer`

    ```bash
    npm install -g yo @plone/generator-volto mrs-developer
    ```

1.  Create new volto app

    ```bash
    yo @plone/volto my-volto-project --addon @eeacms/volto-accordion-block --skip-install
    cd my-volto-project
    ```

1.  Add the following to `mrs.developer.json`:

    ```JSON
    {
        "volto-accordion-block": {
            "url": "https://github.com/eea/volto-accordion-block.git",
            "package": "@eeacms/volto-accordion-block",
            "branch": "develop",

1.  Start frontend

    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```

## Cypress

To run cypress locally, first make sure you don't have any Volto/Plone running on ports `8080` and `3000`.

You don't have to be in a `clean-volto-project`, you can be in any Volto Frontend
project where you added `volto-accordion-block` to `mrs.developer.json`

Go to:

  ```bash
  cd src/addons/volto-accordion-block/
  ```

Start:

  ```bash
  make
  make start
  ```

This will build and start with Docker a clean `Plone backend` and `Volto Frontend` with `volto-accordion-block` block installed.

Open Cypress Interface:

  ```bash
  make cypress-open
  ```

Or run it:

  ```bash
  make cypress-run
  ```

## Prettier

[Prettier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier) is an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it
with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.

To fix the ``prettier`` warnings, execute the following command:

  ```bash
  make prettier-fix
  ```

## Eslint

[ESLint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint) is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code.

Eslint should run just fine using the setup config from any Volto projects generated by `volto project generator`.

If for some reason that doesn't work, and you need to manually install eslint,
you can also use the following steps to install eslint.

For installing ``eslint``, execute the following command:

  ```bash
  yarn add --dev eslint eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y eslint-plugin-prettier eslint-plugin-react-hooks eslint-plugin-import eslint-plugin-flowtype
  ```

For setting up ``eslint``, execute the following command:

  ```bash
  cp .project.eslintrc.js .eslintrc.js
  ```

Run ``eslint``, executing the following command:

  ```bash
  make lint
  ```

To fix the problems found by ``eslint``, execute the following command:

  ```bash
  make lint-fix
  ```

## Stylelint

[Stylelint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stylelint) is a mighty CSS linter that helps you avoid errors and enforce conventions.

For installing ``stylelint``, execute the following command:

  ```bash
  yarn add --dev stylelint
  ```

To run ``stylelint``, execute the following command:

  ```bash
  make stylelint
  ```

If you need to run ``stylelint`` on styles found in .overrides files, execute the following command:

  ```

To auto fix the found issues by ``stylelint``, execute the following command:
